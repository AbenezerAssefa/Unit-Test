# Unit-test

### Unit Testing Using Jest with the AAA Pattern

- Jest is a Javascript Testing framework built by Facebook.
- In this exercise, I wrote a few practical tests for JavaScript functions using the Jest library.
- I followed the AAA pattern to make the tests easier for other developers to read and understand. And also I used TDD approach in practice.

# Getting Started

- To install Jest run `                      npm install --save-dev jest
                    `
- To run the test `                      npm test
                    `
